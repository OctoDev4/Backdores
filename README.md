> ⚠️ **Safety & Ethics Notice**
> This repository contains code that demonstrates network/socket programming and file/resource handling. It may include examples that resemble remote-control logic. **Do not** deploy or use any code that gives remote control of systems on machines you do not own or systems for which you do not have explicit written authorization. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. Use the instructions below only in isolated lab environments (local VMs, offline networks, or test benches) and only for educational purposes.

## Overview
This project demonstrates:
- resource handling for bundling files with PyInstaller (images, PDFs),
- cross-mode resource lookup (script vs. PyInstaller `sys._MEIPASS`),
- basic socket client structure (educational only),
- utilities to open platform-native files (e.g., opening a PDF on Windows),
- logging setup and safe file/directory management patterns.

> The repository is intended for study and defensive research. If your academic advisor requires networked demonstrations, use the **safe demo** included below rather than any remote-control code.
